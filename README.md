Hello! This is a simple Android Java project implementing the assignment on Perpule Coding Challenge. A few assumptions I've made are below.

1. Unit tests for Domain classes avoided (intentionally due to time constraint).

2. As mentioned in the assignment, Splash animation, offline support, prefetching next song, implementaion using service/IntentService

3. No user input required, just launch the app

4. Apart from RXJava & Retrofit, animation and Butterknife external dependency has been added.

5. App follows MVVM structure

Please do pass detailed feedback after your review. Thanks for reading!
